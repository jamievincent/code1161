TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
This week we learned how to do a few basic programs in Python. Some of the exercises were hard to undertand without help, especially exercises 0 and 2. Exercise 1 was pretty straight forward and we saw it being done on the screen. For the others we worked them out by googling and trial and error, if it didn't work, we changed the wording slightly and eventually it would work. I found exercise 3 really hard and I also found it difficult to find answers to the questions. I also had some issues with pulling from upstream at the beginning of the tutorial, but I think that is sorted now. I understand what strings, functions, variables are, but I still don't understand some of the syntax and wording for python.
