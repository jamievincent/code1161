TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
this week I continued to think about how I could display my analysed data and how I can answer the question of - "What is the unhealiest item on the McDonalds (US) menu." I also have to define what "unhealthy" means in terms of nutrition information.
EDIT: I've changed my dataset and now I'm doing Chocolate Bar Ratings and the question I'm answering is: "Which country produces the best chocolate". I'm quite confused about which libraries I need to import into my notebook and I'm not really sure what they mean. I'm also finding it quite hard to get my graphs to work - I'll create one graph and it works and then I'll try to make another one but with different data and it doesn't work. It's just very frustrating and it's eating up a lot of my time.
