TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
this week I was catching up on work from the past 2 weeks since I was sick. I found the dataset I'm going to use for my project - McDonalds menu nutrition. I'm not 100% sure what my question is yet but probably either the healiest or unhealiest item on the menu. I'm still really not comfortable using python and vscode, all the software and stuff really confuses me - for example I thought I lost the "code1161" files but I just had the wrong files open in vscode. I'm still really confused about the machine learning project from 2 weeks ago - not sure what the purpose of it was or what we were actually doing.
