TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
This week I found the exercises pretty difficult. In the first exercise I was a bit confused as to what the questions wanted me to do. Also I wasn't sure whether I needed to do anything for exercise 2? For some reason my exercise 3 won't import exercise 1 and I'm finding it quite difficult to do that one. I'm also very confused as to what exercise 4 wants me to do, it looks the same as exercise 3...
