TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
This week I found the exercises pretty difficult. In the first exercise I was a bit confused as to what the questions wanted me to do. Also I wasn't sure whether I needed to do anything for exercise 2? For some reason my exercise 3 won't import exercise 1 and I'm finding it quite difficult to do that one. I'm also very confused as to what exercise 4 wants me to do, it looks the same as exercise 3... 
So we're continuing these exercises into wk4. In the tutorial Danielle helped me understand how to do some of the parts in exercise 1, but I had it mostly right. I also was able to use the python terminal thing which allowed me to see if I had actually passed the exercise. The last 2 parts of exercise 1 were working fine but the tests didn't like them for some reason which is frustrating because I don't know where I went wrong. Danielle and Aiden also looked at the exercise and said it was fine so I don't know what's happening there. I still don't understand how to do exercise 3 or 4.
